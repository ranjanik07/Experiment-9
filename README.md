## Test cases for banking applications 
Aim : To understand the complexities of banking applications and develop comprehensive test cases to ensure robust and secure operation.

Introduction : Banking applications are among the most complex systems in the software industry due to their multifaceted operations, stringent security requirements, and the need for integration with various external and internal processes. This experiment explores what makes banking applications inherently complex, the recommended testing approach, and essential test cases for common banking workflows.

Key Characteristics of Banking Applications Multi-tier architectures supporting thousands of concurrent sessions Extensive integration with utilities, trading systems, etc. Complex business workflows involving real-time and batch processing High transaction throughput Secure and robust reporting for daily operations Strong auditing and issue resolution Massive storage and effective disaster management Regulatory compliance and industry standards adherence Typical Architecture A typical banking application includes:

Web server (user interface layer) Middle tier (business logic and validation) Database (data management and storage) Transaction processor (mainframe/legacy integration) Testing Approach for Banking Applications A comprehensive, end-to-end approach is necessary to cover:

All business workflows Functional and security aspects Data integrity, concurrency, and user experience Modern methodologies like Agile/Scrum, RUP, and Continuous Integration with tools such as VSTS and IBM Rational are commonly used.

Banking Application Testing Workflow image The testing workflow generally follows these stages:

Requirement Gathering Collect requirements from stakeholders and document them as functional specifications or use cases.

Requirement Review Cross-functional review to ensure business needs are correctly captured and workflows are not violated.

Business Scenario Preparation High-level business scenarios are derived from requirements to ensure complete coverage.

Functional Testing

Test Case Preparation: Creating detailed test cases (positive and negative) from business scenarios. Test Case Review: Peer QA review. Test Case Execution: Manual or automated execution. Database Testing

Data loading, migration, schema validation Stored procedures, functions, triggers Data integrity checks Security Testing

Application scan (tools: IBM AppScan, HP WebInspect, Burp Suite, etc.) Identifying and reporting vulnerabilities User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

End-user validation to ensure seamless experience and full functionality Common Test Cases: Opening a Bank Account Input Parameter Verification Name Date of Birth Photo Address proof Identity proof Introducer (if required) PAN card Initial deposit Facilities required (chequebook, ATM card, online banking) Customer signature Account Types Savings account Salary account Joint account Current account Recurring deposit (RD) account Company account

## Result
The above workflow and cases offer a comprehensive strategy to effectively test banking applications, addressing the functional, data, and security requirements of these sophisticated systems.
